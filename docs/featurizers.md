`RDKit Descriptors`
: A discriptor of 210 bits where each bit represents a physical property such as number of valence electrons or the presence or absence of a small functional group.

`MACCS keys`
: A descriptor of 166 bits where each bit position represents the presence or absence of a pre-defined structural feature such as functional groups.

`2D circular fingerprint`
: In circular fingerprints, a molecule is broken down into all possible substructures. The largest allowed size of the substructures are determined by the radius. Our implementation uses a radius of 6, a bit vector of size 2048, and explicitly considers chirality. The featurizer is also known as ECFP (=extended circular fingerprint), and is similar to Morgan fingerprints.

`2D pharmacophore`
: The molecules is translated to a 2D map of pharmacophore elements - hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen bond donor, basic group, acidic group, hydrophobic group, halogen, attachment point to an aliphatic ring, and attachment point to an aromatic ring. Results in a vector of size 39972.

`3D circular fingerprint`
: Analogous to 2D circular fingerprints, but instead of mapping substructures based on connectivity it is mapped based on spacial proximity. Our implementation uses a radius multiplier of 1.5 Ã… and results in a vector of size 2048. The featurizer is also known as E3FP.

`Coulomb matrix`
: A representation of the electronic structure of a molecule. Each element in the matrix denotes the electronic interaction strength between two atoms in the molecule.

`Mordred fingerprint`
: A descriptor of 1827 bits that are based on a variety of atomic and molecular properties such as molecular weight, bond count, polarizability, and moment of inertia. Our implementation requires a 3D structure of the molecule.
