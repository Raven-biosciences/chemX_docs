ChemX is a cloud-based application that is accessed through [chemx.ravensai.com](https://chemx.ravensai.com/). All computations run on Raven biosciences' servers, and the only thing you need is an internet connection.

For optimal usage of the interface we recommend using monitors in full HD (1920:1080, 16:9 aspect ratio) resolution. Lower resolutions will work, but the layout will be perturbed (e.g. folding in the left-hand side panel and stacking images vertically instead of horisontally).
