Please send a brief description of the feature you want and why you need it to chemx-support@ravenbiosciences.com <code>I emailed support with a question - when can I expect to hear back?</code> We always get back to you as soon as possible and strive to do so within 24 hours. <code>Can I try out ChemX before buying it?</code> Yes, it is possible to get access to a trial version of ChemX. The trial version is fully funtional except for the option to upload your own dataset. You can only test on pre-linked datasets from MoleculeNet."},{"location":"FAQ/#technical-aspects","title":"Technical aspects","text":"<code>Is there a limit to how many molecules I can model at once?</code> Yes, there is a hard limit of 200,000 molecules during modelling. We recommend using less than 100,000 molecules for modelling to keep the experience smooth. <code>Is there a limit on how many molecules I can screen at once?</code> No, there is no limit to how many molecules you can screen; however, be aware that even the rapid 1-dimensional featurizers like RDKit take hours to calculate for 1 mio. molecules. <code>How do I reverse a transformation on my screening results so I can interpret my results?</code> You don't have to! We realize that data transformations are sometimes unkown territory for our users, so we have applied a de-transformation step before you see any of the results - for MAE's, counterfactuals etc during modelling, and in your screening results later on. <code>How are the molecules sanitized?</code> Sanitization includes checking the valence state of all atoms, standardization of tautomers, neutralization of molecules (if possible), and removal of hydrogen atoms unless they have an explicitly set isotope, are attached to a chiral atom, or attached to an atom with unusual valence state. If salts or solvents are present in your dataset, the salts will be removed by the sanitizer, and the parent molecule remains. If a molecule fails sanitization it is removed from the dataset. <code>I don't understand the UMAPs. How do they work?</code> It can be tough to build intuition around dimensionality reduction techniques, but don't worry, with practice you will get there. To get you started, here is a link to a great video by StatQuest that has a great visualization during the explanation of the UMAP concept.  <code>My counterfactuals are so different from my representative molecule that I can't derive a structure-property relationship</code> Good counterfactuals can be made if the dataset contains many similar molecules, but this is not always the case. Try looking for additional representative molecules that may have more similar molecules in your dataset or have a look at the feature importance plots instead. <code>None of my features in the feature importance plot are significant</code> Unfortunately, not all datasets can be explained well by feature importance. If your target data is a physical property then feature importance is often a good tool, but if the target parameter is an affinity or a potency then a counterfactual analysis might be more helpful."},{"location":"FAQ/#feature-requests","title":"Feature requests","text":"<code>I like using ChemX, but I wish it had a python API. Can you make one?</code> Yes, a python API is being built for ChemX and is expected to be included in the next release of ChemX. <code>I know some of my molecules are (de)protonated at the pH I run my experiment, but sanitization removes all changes I make in my csv-file. What do I do?</code> If you expect the protonation state to be important for predicting your target paramater, then you have to edit your SMILES accordingly and deselect sanitization upon upload to ChemX. However, we are building an addition to ChemX that will adjust protonation states accoring to a user-set pH. We expect to include it in the next release of ChemX. <code>Can ChemX help with outlier detection?</code> No, ChemX cannot directly help you identify outliers as it is very difficult to know if a molecule is an outlier or e.g. an important activity cliff. However, we are working on different ways of helping users find and assess potential outliers, and expect to include it in the next release of ChemX."},{"location":"eula/","title":"RavensAI ChemX","text":""},{"location":"eula/#terms-conditions","title":"Terms &amp; Conditions","text":""},{"location":"eula/#software-as-a-service-licensing-agreement","title":"Software as a Service &amp; Licensing agreement","text":"<p>These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of RavensAI ChemX, reference to Raven biosciences\u2019\u202fwebsite, located at RavensAI ChemX website.

It only works on positive data points, so your data is shifted if you have negative values in your target data. <code>Counterfactual</code> A counterfactual molecule is a molecule of high structural similarity with low property similarity relative to a base molecule. As an example, if your base molecule is a strong inhibitor of its target protein, then a counterfactual molecule will be a poor inhibitor that is structurally very similar to the base molecule. <code>Featurization</code> Molecules have to be translated into vector or matrix format before you can train a machine learning model. This is called featurization of the molecules.  <code>Hyperparameters</code> While training models, an algorithm will optimize its parameters, e.g. the slope and intercept for a linear regression, but the algorithm\u2019s hyperparameters are set before training and each algorithm has its own et of hyperparameters that adjusts how it models the data. For example, for a random forest algorithm, hyperparameters include number of trees, leaf size, splitting criteria to name a few. <code>Kurtosis</code> Kurtosis refers to a distribution being heavy- or light-tailed compared to a normal distribution or, in other words, being a flat or pointy distribution. <code>Sanitization</code> Sanitization is the processing of SMILES strings to viable molecules.It includes checking the valence state of all atoms, standardization of tautomers, neutralization of molecules (if possible), and removal of hydrogen atoms unless they have an explicitly set isotope, are attached to a chiral atom, or attached to an atom with unusual valence state. If salts or solvents are present in your dataset, the salts will be removed by the sanitizer, and the . If a molecule fails sanitization it is removed from the dataset. <code>Skew</code> Skew refers to the symmetry of a distribution around the mean. <code>Surrogate model</code> A surrogate model is an interpretable model that is modelled in the local area around a data point of interest, e.g. the best performin molecule. <code>Tanimoto similarity</code> Tanimoto similarity ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 being identical molecules, and is calculated as the normalized overlap between the feature representations of two molecules. In this implementation, the selected featurizer is 2D circular fingerprints. <code>Target parameter</code> The target parameter is the physical parameter that you are training a model to predict. It could be e.g. membrane permeability or binding affinity. <code>Thoroughness</code> The thoroughness parameter influences the tuning effort during model training. More effort will find better models, but also takes more time. Consider using Preliminary for a first, quick assessment. <code>UMAP</code> A UMAP is a reduced dimension representation of the chemical complexity. If two molecules are very different according to their circular fingerprints, then they are distant in the UMAP and vice versa. Note, the exact distance between two clusters is not interpretable and the size of a cluster relative to other cluster sizes is also not interpretable. <code>Yeo-Johnson transformation</code> A Yeo-Johnson transformation belongs to the family of power transformations and it transforms non-normally distributed data to (near)normally distributed data.

It is calculated as one minus the ratio of the MSE of the model predictions over the MSE of the trivial model predictions (constant number). A value of 1 indicates perfect predictions, while values around 0 indicate that the regression results are no different than the trivial approach of constantly predicting the average value of the outcome. Negative values indicate that the model is worse than the trivial approach.  <code>Classic R\u00b2</code> This implementation of R\u00b2 measures the proportion of the outcome variance explained by the predictions. A value of 1 indicates perfect predictions while values around 0 indicate that the regression has no predicting power beyond just predicting the outcome mean. Negative values indicate that the model delivers predictions that are negatively correlated with the outcome. <code>Mean absolute error</code> The average difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome. Higher values indicate poorer prediction quality, while a value of 0 indicates perfect predictions. <code>Mean squared error</code> The average of the squared difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome. Higher values indicate poorer prediction quality, while a value of 0 indicates perfect predictions. <code>Mean squared logarithmic error</code> The average of the squared difference between the logarithms of theactual outcome and the predicted outcome. Higher values indicate poorer prediction quality, while a value of 0 indicates perfect predictions. <code>Pearson correlation coefficient</code> The correlation between actual outcome and the predicted outcome, computed according to Pearson's formula. Use this coefficient if a strong relation between the target parameter and molecular structure is expected. A value of 1 indicates perfect concordance between predictions and actual values, -1 means perfect discordance, while 0 indicates no relation whatsoever. <code>Relative absolute error</code> The average percentage difference between the actual outcome and the predicted values. Higher values indicate poorer prediction quality, while a value of 0 indicates perfect predictions. For example, a value of 0.1 indicates that the predictions are on average 10% off with respect to the actual outcome. <code>Relative squared error</code> The average of the squared difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome, reported as a percentage. Higher values indicate poorer prediction quality, while a value of 0 indicates perfect predictions. <code>Spearman correlation coefficient</code> The correlation between actual outcome and the predicted outcome, computed according to Spearman's formula.

Use this measure to evaluate balanced datasets with near equal data points in each bin (use the balance and entropy scores found under the \"Target Parameters\" tab in ChemX as guides if needed). A measure of how well a model can distinguish between two groups (e.g. cases/controls). An area of 1 represents a perfect model, an area of 0.5 represents random guessing. <code>Average precision</code> Also known as the area-under-the-precision-recall curve. Use this measure to evaluate imbalanced datasets (use the balance and entropy scores found under the \"Target Parameters\" tab in ChemX as guides if needed). The precision-Recall curve shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for different thresholds. A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate. <code>Accuracy</code> The fraction of predictions that a classification model got right. In multi-class classification, accuracy is defined as: correct predictions/total number of observations. <code>Average F1 Score</code> The average F1 score across all classes. <code>Average MCC</code> Average Matthews correlation criterion across all classes. <code>Balanced accuracy</code> The average of Sensitivity and Specificity, obtained by thresholding the prediction values at zero. It is defined as Balanced Accuracy = (Sensitivity + Specificity) / 2. <code>F1 Score</code> Harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is defined as F1 score = 2 \u22c5 (Recall \u22c5 Precision) / (Recall + Precision). <code>False negative ratio</code> The number of false negatives divided by the total number of predictions. <code>False Positive ratio</code> The number of false positives divided by the total number of predictions. <code>Matthews correlation criterion (phi coefficient)</code> The coefficient takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications; it returns a value between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. <code>Precision</code> A measure how many positives were predicted correctly out of the total number of positive predictions. It is defined as Precision = TP / (TP + FP). <code>Specificity</code> Also known as the True Negative Rate. A measure of how many of the negative predictions were correct. It is defined as Specificity = TN / (TN + FP). <code>True negative ratio</code> The number of true negatives divided by the total number of predictions. <code>True positive rate</code> Also known as Recall or Sensitivity.

Especially ZINC is very handy, as you can download molecule libraries of lead-like molecules or other curated subsets and filter on compound purchasability. </p> <p>To apply a model, simply navigate to the model you want to use or the screening library you want to use it on and click Screen with Model in the Workflow panel on the right.

This will bring you to the below view.</p> <p></p> <p>Here you get an overview of the predicted performance of your library. Did anything perform better than your original dataset? </p> <p>When evaluating the results it is important to consider the model\u2019s applicability to your screening library. One way to assess this is by using UMAPs - the reduced dimensionality plots we have seen a few times in this tutorial already. This time we map both the training data and the screening library in the same map to see if the molecules in the screening library are similar to what the model was trained on. If both datasets exist in the different groupings then the chemical complexity is similar. If the map has many distinct groupings with molecules from only one of the datasets then the model, or if there is no overlap at all, then the model has to extrapolate its learnings to unknown chemistry and you should proceed with caution.</p> <p>IMPORTANT</p> <p>When modelling based on molecular structure, a common pitfall is training you model on one type of chemistry and then using it on another type of chemistry that the model has learnt nothing about. Use the UMAP to evaluate if this is the case for your screening. If the molecules in the screening library overlap with the molecules from the training set you should be okay moving forward. If not, you need additional validation of the results.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#exploring-the-screening-results","title":"Exploring the screening results","text":"<p>When a screening is complete, you can explore the results using the same explainability analyses as was used when probing a model (see the Probing the model section for details). </p> <p>Use the clustering options to identify trends of good performers across the chemical complexity or apply clustering by Murcko scaffold option to look for enriched scaffolds in the data. Perform explainability analysis on top (predicted) performers to ask the model why those molecules were predicted to be so good - what chemical features were important for the prediction and can you start to build a structure-activity relationship from the data?  </p>"},{"location":"videos/","title":"Video guides","text":""},{"location":"videos/#quick-introduction","title":"Quick introduction","text":""},{"location":"videos/#6-minute-walk-through","title":"6 minute walk-through","text":""}]}
