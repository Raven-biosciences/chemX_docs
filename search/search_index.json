ChemX applies a range of different molecular featurizations to help you find the best one for your data. The resulting models can easily be compared through rich visualizations so you can choose the best model based on robust performance metrics for both regression models and classification models.</p> <p>ChemX extracts the model\u2019s learnings after-the-fact and presents them to you as easily interpretable plots of contributing and obstructing chemical properties, structure/property relationships mapped directly onto molecular scaffolds, and AI-generated plain text summaries.</p> <p>The best model is seamlessly implemented into screening workflows by ChemX.

Please send a brief description of the feature you want and why you need it to chemx-support@ravenbiosciences.com <code>I emailed support with a question - when can I expect to hear back?</code> We always get back to you as soon as possible and strive to do so within 24 hours. <code>Can I try out ChemX before buying it?</code> Yes, it is possible to get access to a trial version of ChemX. The trial version is fully funtional except for the option to upload your own dataset. You can only test on pre-linked datasets from MoleculeNet."},{"location":"FAQ/#technical-aspects","title":"Technical aspects","text":"<code>Is there a limit to how many molecules I can model at once?</code> Yes, there is a hard limit of 200,000 molecules during modelling. We recommend using less than 100,000 molecules for modelling to keep the experience smooth. <code>Is there a limit on how many molecules I can screen at once?</code> No, there is no limit to how many molecules you can screen; however, be aware that even the rapid 1-dimensional featurizers like RDKit take hours to calculate for 1 mio. molecules. <code>How do I reverse a transformation on my screening results so I can interpret my results?</code> You don't have to! We realize that data transformations are sometimes unkown territory for our users, so we have applied a de-transformation step before you see any of the results - for MAE's, counterfactuals etc during modelling, and in your screening results later on. <code>How are the molecules sanitized?</code> Sanitization includes checking the valence state of all atoms, standardization of tautomers, neutralization of molecules (if possible), and removal of hydrogen atoms unless they have an explicitly set isotope, are attached to a chiral atom, or attached to an atom with unusual valence state. If salts or solvents are present in your dataset, the salts will be removed by the sanitizer, and the parent molecule remains. If a molecule fails sanitization it is removed from the dataset. <code>I don't understand the UMAPs. How do they work?</code> It can be tough to build intuition around dimensionality reduction techniques, but don't worry, with practice you will get there. To get you started, here is a link to a great video by StatQuest that has a great visualization during the explanation of the UMAP concept.  <code>My counterfactuals are so different from my representative molecule that I can't derive a structure-property relationship</code> Good counterfactuals can be made if the dataset contains many similar molecules, but this is not always the case. Try looking for additional representative molecules that may have more similar molecules in your dataset or have a look at the feature importance plots instead. <code>None of my features in the feature importance plot are significant</code> Unfortunately, not all datasets can be explained well by feature importance. If your target data is a physical property then feature importance is often a good tool, but if the target parameter is an affinity or a potency then a counterfactual analysis might be more helpful."},{"location":"FAQ/#feature-requests","title":"Feature requests","text":"<code>I like using ChemX, but I wish it had a python API. Can you make one?</code> Yes, a python API is being built for ChemX and is expected to be included in the next release of ChemX. <code>I know some of my molecules are (de)protonated at the pH I run my experiment, but sanitization removes all changes I make in my csv-file. What do I do?</code> If you expect the protonation state to be important for predicting your target paramater, then you have to edit your SMILES accordingly and deselect sanitization upon upload to ChemX. However, we are building an addition to ChemX that will adjust protonation states accoring to a user-set pH. We expect to include it in the next release of ChemX. <code>Can ChemX help with outlier detection?</code> No, ChemX cannot directly help you identify outliers as it is very difficult to know if a molecule is an outlier or e.g. an important activity cliff. However, we are working on different ways of helping users find and assess potential outliers, and expect to include it in the next release of ChemX."},{"location":"eula/","title":"RavensAI ChemX","text":""},{"location":"eula/#terms-conditions","title":"Terms &amp; Conditions","text":""},{"location":"eula/#software-as-a-service-licensing-agreement","title":"Software as a Service &amp; Licensing agreement","text":"<p>These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of RavensAI ChemX, reference to Raven biosciences\u2019\u202fwebsite, located at RavensAI ChemX website.

It only works on positive data points, so your data is shifted if you have negative values in your target data. <code>Counterfactual</code> A counterfactual molecule is a molecule of high structural similarity with low property similarity relative to a base molecule. As an example, if your base molecule is a strong inhibitor of its target protein, then a counterfactual molecule will be a poor inhibitor that is structurally very similar to the base molecule. <code>Featurization</code> Molecules have to be translated into vector or matrix format before you can train a machine learning model. This is called featurization of the molecules.  <code>Hyperparameters</code> While training models, an algorithm will optimize its parameters, e.g. the slope and intercept for a linear regression, but the algorithm\u2019s hyperparameters are set before training and each algorithm has its own et of hyperparameters that adjusts how it models the data. For example, for a random forest algorithm, hyperparameters include number of trees, leaf size, splitting criteria to name a few. <code>Kurtosis</code> Kurtosis refers to a distribution being heavy- or light-tailed compared to a normal distribution or, in other words, being a flat or pointy distribution. <code>Sanitization</code> Sanitization is the processing of SMILES strings to viable molecules.It includes checking the valence state of all atoms, standardization of tautomers, neutralization of molecules (if possible), and removal of hydrogen atoms unless they have an explicitly set isotope, are attached to a chiral atom, or attached to an atom with unusual valence state. If salts or solvents are present in your dataset, the salts will be removed by the sanitizer, and the . If a molecule fails sanitization it is removed from the dataset. <code>Skew</code> Skew refers to the symmetry of a distribution around the mean. <code>Surrogate model</code> A surrogate model is an interpretable model that is modelled in the local area around a data point of interest, e.g. the best performin molecule. <code>Tanimoto similarity</code> Tanimoto similarity ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 being identical molecules, and is calculated as the normalized overlap between the feature representations of two molecules. In this implementation, the selected featurizer is 2D circular fingerprints. <code>Target parameter</code> The target parameter is the physical parameter that you are training a model to predict. It could be e.g. membrane permeability or binding affinity. <code>Thoroughness</code> The thoroughness parameter influences the tuning effort during model training. More effort will find better models, but also takes more time. Consider using Preliminary for a first, quick assessment. <code>UMAP</code> A UMAP is a reduced dimension representation of the chemical complexity. If two molecules are very different according to their circular fingerprints, then they are distant in the UMAP and vice versa. Note, the exact distance between two clusters is not interpretable and the size of a cluster relative to other cluster sizes is also not interpretable. <code>Yeo-Johnson transformation</code> A Yeo-Johnson transformation belongs to the family of power transformations and it transforms non-normally distributed data to (near)normally distributed data.

The resulting featurization can not be translated back to a molecular structure. 2D featurizers are based on the molecular topology, while 3D featurizers depend on a molecule\u2019s 3D structure.
